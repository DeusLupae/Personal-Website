        <p class="bodyText">
            My name is Thea Blakley (she/her). I'm a trans girl and a sapphic. I am this stereotype in every way. If you have a problem with that, you can click off my website and not return.

        <p class="bodyText">
            I study Spanish and Latin, and I'm learning Japanese. I consider myself to be a Linguist, in the same way that a twelve-year-old with an Xbox 360 and Minecraft considers himself to be a gamer. I am, in this same way, a philosopher.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="bodyText">
            I have 3 siblings: a younger brother named Tucker (14), a younger adopted half-sister on my Mom's side named Bailey (16), and a baby half-brother on my Dad's side named Parker (2).

        <p class="bodyText">
            I enjoy reading, writing, learning and studying languages, playing D&#38;D and other TTRPGs, and playing (certain) videogames. I love Star Wars, Percy Jackson, vampires of any kind, romance novel (fantasy only), and basically any other Sci-Fi/Fantasy book I've read or movie I've watched. I used to like Harry Potter, but I refuse to give money to a terf.
        </p>
        <p class="bodyText">
            I like math and science, and I am willing to tutor in those subjects (See <a href="hireme.html">Services</a>). I can also tutor is Spanish or Latin.
        </p>

            I am an active member of The Satanic Temple (not to be confused with the Church of Satan). Ave Domine Inferne.
