        <p id="bodyText">
            My name is Thea Blakley (she/her), but you may have heard me called Cooper. I'm a trans girl and a sapphic. I am this stereotype in every way. If you have a problem with that, you can click off my website and not return.

        <p id="bodyText">
            I study Spanish and Latin, and I'm learning Italian. I consider myself to be a Linguist, in the same way that a twelve-year-old with an Xbox 360 and Minecraft considers himself to be a gamer. I am, in this same way, a philosopher.
        </p>
        <p id="bodyText">
            I have 3 siblings: a younger brother named Tucker (13), a younger adopted half-sister on my Mom's side named Bailey (16), and a baby half-brother on my Dad's side named Parker (nearly 2).
        </p>
        <p id="bodyText">
            I enjoy reading, writing, learning and studying languages, playing D&#38;D, and playing (certain) videogames. I love Star Wars, Percy Jackson, and basically any other Sci-Fi/Fantasy book I've read or movie I've watched. I used to like Harry Potter, but I refuse to give money to a terf.
        </p>
        <p id="bodyText">
            I like math and science, and I am willing to tutor in those subjects (See <a href="hireme.html">Services</a>). I can also tutor is Spanish or Latin.
